## Me in Academia 🎓

I am a Medical Physics Resident (PGY-2) undergoing [residency training](https://sites.rutgers.edu/cinj-radiation-oncology/medical-physics-residency/) at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital and Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey. 
> **I am currently open to a faculty position starting 📅June/July 2025! Get in touch！**

### During my PhD 🎓
I received rigorous and extensive training under [Dr Guang-Hong Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nw7lybEAAAAJ&hl=en). My research specialties include 🔹[Quality-assured x-ray CT reconstruction](/research/research-1), 🔹[interior problem](/research/research-2)m, 🔹[patiant-specific quantitative image quality assessment](/research/research-3) and 🔹[two-view problem](/research/research-4). Among them, I have published 5 first-authored, peer-reviewed [journal papers](/publication)📄, one book chapter🔖, 13 oral presentations🎤 and numerous conference proceedings. Additionally, I have significant experience in 🔹[Chest X-ray based COVID-19 classification](/research/research-5), 🔹perfusion imaging, and 🔹accelerated MRI. These works were presented as first-author conference papers or published as co-authors papers. 

### During my Residency 🏥
I received intensive and comprehensive clinical training (see my 📆[timeline](/clinical)). I have also engaged in various clinical projects to improve patient care, including 🔸[developing institutional VMAT-TBI](/clinical/clinical-TBI) procedures, 🔸utilizing [beam-specific dosimetric leaf gap DLG](/clinical/clinical-DLG) to enhance beam fluence calculation accuracy, and 🔸implementing [surface-guided imaging SGRT for the tattoo-less right breast RT protocol](/clinical/clinical-SGRT). These projects have greatly benefited from my [ESAPI](/clinical/clinical-ESAPI) skills.

My residency has fostered my interest in 🔹[radiomics-guided radiation therapy](/research/research-5). I am closely working with [Dr Ke Nie](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1BKalcwAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr Matthew Deek](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LDJBBWEAAAAJ&hl=en) on 🔜 the prognostic value of the [habitat radiomic features](/images/HabitatProstate1.png) in pre- and post-op and multi-modality (CT/PSMA/MRI) images and 🔜[PSMA elevated bone oligomets prediction by radio-genomics](/files/bonemets.pdf). Preliminary results can be found [here](/images/HabitatProstate2.png). I also developed strong interest to MR-Linac and I am currently commissioning the first [MR-Linac](/clinical/clinical-MRLC) in the new [Sheryl Morris Cancer Center](https://www.rwjbh.org/blog/2024/january/coming-soon-new-jersey-s-first-freestanding-canc/)🏥.

Apart from the busy training schedule residency, I started a 📷[instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/nbmedphys?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&igsh=ZDNlZDc0MzIxNw==) for the program and created a customized 📌[google map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1BZHwVmbjk2Ad-1wKqSe_PJH9om_h5Fs&usp=sharing) for my coresidents.

### Academic Service 📧
I am serving associate editor appointment✒️ in [Medical Physics Editorial Board (MPEB)](https://www.aapm.org/org/structure/default.asp?committee_code=MPBAE) of AAPM starting 1/1/2023. I am actively reviewing papers (over 100 times) for 📘[Medical Physics](https://aapm.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/24734209), 📗[Physics in Medicine & Biology](https://iopscience.iop.org/journal/0031-9155), 📕[the Red Journal](https://www.redjournal.org/), 📓[Transactions of Computational Imaging](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=6745852), 📔[Frontiers in Oncology](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/oncology), 📒[Journal of Medical Imaging](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-medical-imaging#_=_).

## Me in Life 🎶
I am a [INFJ-A](https://www.16personalities.com/infj-personality) type person. I generously contribute energy to the group but tend to gain energy from doing things alone. My passion about musical instruments has been signifcant part of my life. I have played the 🪗accordion since childhood, achieving 🏆national second place in my age group. In 2013, I joined the 🎻Tsinghua Student Arts Troupe and served the chair of the "Clavier" Accordion team. You can see some of my performances 📺[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7G1gQj_ozg) and 📺[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bYkOFqpb14). In the past year, I have also taken up the piano 🎹, developing a wide-ranging repertoire such as 🎼[Chopin's "Heroic" Polonaise in A flat major Op. 53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZYYoDDmg8M) and 🎼[Listz' Liebestraum No. 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhW_tRmpLFs) and etc. Besides music, I enjoy working out💪, [Lesmil's body combat](https://www.lesmills.com/us/workouts/fitness-classes/bodycombat/)✊ and playing basketball🏀 with my friends.
