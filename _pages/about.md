## Me in Academia 🎓

I am a Medical Physics Resident (PGY-2) undergoing [residency training](https://sites.rutgers.edu/cinj-radiation-oncology/medical-physics-residency/) at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital and Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey. 
> **I am currently open to a faculty position starting 📅June/July 2025! Get in touch！**

### During my PhD 🎓
I received extensive training in 🔹[AI-based x-ray CT reconstruction](/research/research-1), 🔹[interior problem](/research/research-2), and 🔹[patiant-specific quantitative image quality assessment](/research/research-3). Among them, I have published 5 first-authored, peer-reviewed [journal papers](/publication)📄, one book chapter🔖, 13 oral presentations🎤 and numerous conference proceedings. Additionally, I have significant experience in 🔹[x-ray imaging classification](/publication/2019-CV19Net-2), 🔹[perfusion imaging](/research/research-4), and 🔹accelerated MRI. These works were presented as first-author conference papers or published as co-authors papers. 

### During my Residency 🏥
My residency has fostered my interest in 🔹[radiomics-guided radiation therapy]('/research/research-5'). I am closely working with Dr Ke Nie and Dr Matthew Deek on 🔜Habitat radiomics-guided prostate cancer focal and salvage boost radiation therapy and 🔜[PSMA elevated bone oligomets prediction by radio-genomics](/files/bonemets.pdf). I also developed strong interest to MR-Linac and are closely working with Dr Meral Reyhan to commission the first [MR-Linac](https://www.elekta.com/products/radiation-therapy/unity/) in the new [Sheryl Morris Cancer Center](https://www.rwjbh.org/blog/2024/january/coming-soon-new-jersey-s-first-freestanding-canc/)🏥.

While undergoing intensive clinical training (see my 📆[timeline](/clinical)), I have also engaged in various clinical projects to improve patient care, including 🔸[developing institutional VMAT-TBI](/clinical/clinical-TBI) procedures, 🔸utilizing [beam-specific dosimetric leaf gap DLG](/clinical/clinical-DLG) to enhance beam fluence calculation accuracy, and 🔸implementing [surface-guided imaging SGRT for the tattoo-less right breast RT protocol](/clinical/clinical-SGRT). These projects have greatly benefited from my [ESAPI](/clinical/clinical-ESAPI) skills.

Apart from the busy training schedule residency, I started a 📷[instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/nbmedphys?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&igsh=ZDNlZDc0MzIxNw==) for the program and created a customized 📌[google map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1BZHwVmbjk2Ad-1wKqSe_PJH9om_h5Fs&usp=sharing) for my coresidents.

### Academic Service 🏥
I am serving associate editor appointment✒️ in [Medical Physics Editorial Board (MPEB)](https://www.aapm.org/org/structure/default.asp?committee_code=MPBAE) of AAPM starting 1/1/2023. I am actively reviewing papers (over 80 times) for 📘[Medical Physics](https://aapm.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/24734209), 📗[Physics in Medicine & Biology](https://iopscience.iop.org/journal/0031-9155), 📕[the Red Journal](https://www.redjournal.org/), 📓[Transactions of Computational Imaging](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=6745852), 📔[Frontiers in Oncology](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/oncology), 📒[Journal of Medical Imaging](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-medical-imaging#_=_).

## Me in Personal Life 🎶
I am a [INFJ-A](https://www.16personalities.com/infj-personality) type person. I generously contribute energy to the group but tend to gain energy from doing things alone. My passion about musical instruments has been signifcant part of my life. I have played the accordion since childhood, achieving national second place in my age group. In 2013, I joined the Tsinghua Student Arts Troupe and served the chair of the "Clavier" Accordion team. You can see some of my performances 📺[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7G1gQj_ozg) and 📺[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bYkOFqpb14). In the past year, I have also taken up the piano 🎹, developing a wide-ranging repertoire such as Chopin's "Heroic" Polonaise in A flat major Op. 53, Listz' Liebestraum No. 3, etc. Besides music, I enjoy working out💪, Lesmil's body combat✊ and playing basketball🏀 with my friends.
