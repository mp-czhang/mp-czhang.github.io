## Me in Academia 🎓

I am currently a Medical Physics Resident (PGY-2) undergoing clinical training at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital and Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey. 

### During my PhD:
I received extensive training in AI-based x-ray CT reconstruction, the interior problem, and quantitative image quality assessment. I have published five first-authored, peer-reviewed journal papers. Additionally, I have significant experience in x-ray imaging classification, perfusion imaging, and accelerated MRI.

### My Residency:
My residency has fostered my interest in radiomics-guided prostate cancer focal and salvage boost radiation therapy. While undergoing intensive clinical training, I have also engaged in various clinical projects, including developing institutional VMAT-TBI procedures, utilizing beam-specific dosimetric leaf gap to enhance beam fluence calculation accuracy, and implementing surface-guided imaging for a tattoo-less right breast protocol. These projects have greatly benefited from my ESAPI skills.

### Beyond My Major Research Work:
I have a special interest in state-of-the-art AI, such as reinforcement learning, diffusion models, and large language models. These fields are well within my skillset and represent potential research directions in the medical physics domain.

## Me in Personal Life 🎶🏀

I am passionate about musical instruments. I have played the accordion since childhood, achieving national second place in my age group. In 2013, I joined the Tsinghua High-level Arts Troupe and participated in numerous concerts. Recently, I have also taken up the piano, developing a wide-ranging repertoire. Besides music, I enjoy working out and playing basketball.
