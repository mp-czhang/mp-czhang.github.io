## Me in Academia üéì

I am a Medical Physics Resident (PGY-2) undergoing [residency training](https://sites.rutgers.edu/cinj-radiation-oncology/medical-physics-residency/) at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital and Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey. 
> **I am currently open to the job market 2024-2025 for a faculty position.**

### During my PhD üéì
I received extensive training in [AI-based x-ray CT reconstruction](/research/research-1), [interior problem](/research/research-2), and [patiant-specific quantitative image quality assessment](/research/research-3). Among them, I have published 5 first-authored, peer-reviewed [journal papers](/publications) and 13 oral presentations and numerous conference proceedings. Additionally, I have significant experience in [x-ray imaging classification], [perfusion imaging](/research/research-4), and [accelerated MRI]. These works were presented as first-author conference papers or published as co-authors papers.

### My Residency üè•
My residency has fostered my interest in [radiomics-guided radiation therapy]. I am closely working with Dr Ke Nie and Dr Matthew Deek on [Habitat radiomics-guided prostate cancer focal and salvage boost radiation therapy] and [PSMA elevated bone oligomets prediction by radio-genomics]. I also developed strong interest to MR-Linac and are closely working with Dr Meral Reyhan to commission the first [MR-Linac] in the new [Sheryl Morris Cancer Center](https://www.rwjbh.org/blog/2024/january/coming-soon-new-jersey-s-first-freestanding-canc/).

While undergoing intensive clinical training, I have also engaged in various clinical projects to improve patient care, including developing institutional [VMAT-TBI](/clinical/clinical-TBI) procedures, utilizing beam-specific dosimetric leaf gap ([DLG])(/clinical/clinical-DLG) to enhance beam fluence calculation accuracy, and implementing surface-guided imaging ([SGRT]) (/clinical/clinical-SGRT) for a tattoo-less right breast protocol. These projects have greatly benefited from my [ESAPI] (/clinical/clinical-ESAPI) skills.

### Beyond My Major Research Work üëÄ
I have a special interest in state-of-the-art AI, such as reinforcement learning, diffusion models, and large language models. These fields are well within my skillset and represent potential research directions in the medical physics domain.

## Me in Personal Life üé∂

I am married to my talented and lovely wife üíå [Hangcheng Zhao](https://hangcheng-zhao.github.io/), who is also looking for a faculty position this semester. I am passionate about musical instruments. I have played the accordion since childhood, achieving national second place in my age group. In 2013, I joined the [Tsinghua High-level Arts Troupe] and participated in numerous concerts. Recently, I have also taken up the piano üéπ, developing a wide-ranging repertoire. Besides music, I enjoy [working out]üí™ and playing [basketball]üèÄ with my friends.
