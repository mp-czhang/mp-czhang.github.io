title: "Research Interest (I): AI-enabled data-consistent image reconstruction"
excerpt: ""
collection: research

- I developed a new framework to accurately measure local noise power spectrum, and patient-specific NPS using PCD-CT. I also developed AI-based bootstrapping framework to estimate patient-specific NPS for a non-linear system .
- I developed 3D volumetric CT reconstruction models under extremal conditions (two-view). The reconstructed AI model can be for diagnostic image quality control and onboard positioning and dose verification.
- I developed quality-assured AI-based medical image reconstruction methods. I combined deep learning and compressed sensing to address the accuracy and generalizability issues in deep learning models.
