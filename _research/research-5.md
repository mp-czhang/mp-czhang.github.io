I developed and evaluated an AI-based COVID-19 pneumonia diagnosis model. I developed an ensemble AI model using multi-center, multi-vendor chest x-ray images that outperformed three radiologists (AUC 0.94 vs 0.85).

CV19-Net inspired scholars worldwide to implement, analyze, and use it as an example for future developments. Roberts et al. [14] performed a large-scale analysis of 2,215 related COVID-19 classification studies to assess their bias and clinical utility. CV19-Net was the only 2 out of 2,215 works that were considered without high risks of bias shown in their Table 1 and the only 4 out of 2215 with a large and balanced testing dataset. 

Dr Summers, Chief of Clinical Image Processing Service and Chief of Imaging Biomarkers and Computer-Aided Diagnosis Laboratory from the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center wrote an editorial [15] in the Radiology journal after the spikes of AI-based COVID-19 related works. He used CV19-Net among thousands of other works on this topic as the illustrative example of binary COVID-19 diagnosis.

The wide recognition of CV19-Net led to its clinical translation into the UW Health clinical workflow and continues to provide decision support for radiologists to prioritize high-risk patients.
