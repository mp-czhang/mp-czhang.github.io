- I developed and evaluated an AI-based COVID-19 pneumonia diagnosis model. I developed an ensemble AI model using multi-center, multi-vendor chest x-ray images that outperformed three radiologists (AUC 0.94 vs 0.85).
- I worked on GEM prostate patient dataset from Turkey with patients who received pre- and post-radiation multi-modal imaging PSMA/CT/mpMRI. I extracted habitat radiomics features to provide risk prognosis of biorecurrence and enable focal boost radiation. The grant proposal and manuscript are in prep.
