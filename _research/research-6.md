title: "Research Interest (VI): Development of imaging markers for metastatic prostate cancer"
excerpt: ""
collection: research
---

- I curated a prostate patient dataset from Turkey with patients who received pre- and post-radiation multi-modal imaging PSMA/MRI.
- I organized the dataset with pre-radiation prostate contour and GTV contour based on PSMA imaging.
- I trained radiomics models to predict the risk of PSA relapse and metastasis.
- I extracted habitat radiomics features to provide risk prognosis of biorecurrence and enable focal boost radiation.
- The grant proposal and manuscript are in prep.
