title: "Varian Truebeam Annual QA"
date: 2024-6-1
excerpt: "I independently finished all the mechanical part of Truebeam annual QA and finished the annual dosimetry under the supervision of the physicist. I learned to use IBA large water tank to perform TG-51 and beam profile measurement (PDD, flatness and symmetry). A comprehensive mechanical check was performed beyong monthly QA including gantry and collimator starshots, output consistency, MU linearity, off-axis ratio consistency, MLC tansmission measurement, DLG measurement, MV and kVCBCT performance etc. An annual shielding survey was performed to verify the integrity of the shielding design."
