title: "Annual Training of Gamma Knife"
date: 2024-8-2
excerpt: "The annual training of gamma knife covers multiple physics and clinical aspect of GK including understanding the physics of Leksell Gamma Knife Icon™ machine, simulation using gamma knife using the Leksell coordinate frome and thermoplastic masks for slice localization, treatment planning and evaluation. I also learned clinical cases of brain mets, meningioma, glioblastoma, trigenminal neuralgia, acoustic neuroma, arteriovenous malformation and their corresponding treatment regimen and dose contraints."
