title: "Brachytherapy rotation"
date: 2024-4-23
excerpt: "During my three-month brachytherapy rotation, I had a comprehensive training in GYN brachytherapy, GU and breast brachytherapy. The involved treatment modality includes cylinder, multi-channel cylinder, T&O, T&R, Interstitial (syed), prostate HDR, prostate LDR, prostate salvage HDR and breast SAVI. Here are the slides I made for TG-43 dose calculation (/files/Brachy_DoseCalc.pdf) for brachytherapy and the slides (/files/Brachy_Prostate.pdf) I made on prostate cancer brachytherapy to conclude my brachytherapy rotation. Please also check my side project slides (/files/MRLinac_Prostate.pdf) on MR-Linac based prostate cancer treatment."
