I independently completed TBI/TSET annual by replicating the patient setup using solid water. I verified the beam output relative to the reference condition. I also verified TMR, diode correction factor and lead shield transmission for TBI annual. I tuned and verified the beam output and baselined dailyQA device for TSET.
