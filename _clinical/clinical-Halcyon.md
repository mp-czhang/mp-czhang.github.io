I independently performed annual QA of the Varian Halcyon™ machine. In the dosimetry part, I set up the IBA 3D water tank on the Halcyon machine. Some highlights are (1) avoilding collision a closed-bore setup, (2) leveling the chamber axes, (3) setting up the reference condition using imaging and (4)setting up the reference chamber without the light field assistance. I performed the measurement of PPD, beam profile and output factor using the myQA Accept software. The output was checked and adjusted by TG-51.
