title: "Varian Halycon™ Annual QA"
date: 2024-8-10
excerpt: "I independently performed annual QA of the Varian Halcyon™ machine. In the dosimetry part, I set up the IBA 3D water tank on the Halcyon machine. Some highlights are (1) avoilding collision a closed-bore setup, (2) leveling the chamber axes, (3) setting up the reference condition using imaging and (4)setting up the reference chamber without the light field assistance. I performed the measurement of PdD, beam profile and output factor using the myQA Accept software. The output was checked and adjusted by TG-51. An annual shielding survey was performed to verify the integrity of the shielding design."
