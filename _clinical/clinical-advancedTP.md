title: "Advanced treatment planning rotation"
date: 2024-1-15
excerpt: "During my three-month advanced planning rotation, I have a comprehensive training on IMRT and SBRT planning over H&N, Shoulder, Lung, Liver, Kidney, GYN, GU. I also spent significant effort studying the several dose calculation algorithms e.g. superposition, monte-carlo and linear boltzman transport equation. I developed my the tool of knowledge-based planning and uncertainty-based dose evaluation based on ESAPI. I also practiced Clearcheck™ and Velocity™ -based rigid and deformable registration. I also took interest in the dose calculation algorithms and derived them such as superposition, AAA, CCC, Linear Boltzman Transport Equation."
