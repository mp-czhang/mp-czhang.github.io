title: "Advanced treatment planning rotation"
date: 2024-1-15
excerpt: "During my three-month advanced planning rotation，I have a comprehensive training on IMRT and SBRT planning over H&N, Shoulder, Lung, Liver, Kidney, GYN, GU. I also spent significant effort study the several dose calculation algorithms such as superposition, monte-carlo and linear boltzman transport equation. I developed my own tool of knowledge-based planning and uncertainty-based dose evaluation."
