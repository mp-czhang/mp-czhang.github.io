title: "MRI/MR-Linac Rotation"
date: 2024-5-1
excerpt: "At the same time of my brachytherapy, I started preparation for the commissioning of Elekta Unity MR-Linac machine expected to land in our new cancer center at the end of 2024. I spent significant amount of effort on the principles of MRI and MR-Linac. I finished the book of [Magnetic Resonance Imaging: Physical Principles and Sequence Design 2nd Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Magnetic-Resonance-Imaging-Physical-Principles-ebook/dp/B00K499M2Y), [Utrecht online lecture](https://mrinradiotherapy.com/information-2024/) and joined the Elekta Unity [MR-Linac Consortium](https://mrlconsortium.org/). I met with the rotation leader on topics of MR-only simulation, MR-Linac setup, MR-Linac reference dosimetry, MR-Linac site-specific treatment. Please also check my educational slides on a preliminary project(/files/MRLinac_Prostate.pdf) on MR-Linac based prostate cancer treatment."
