title: "MRI/MR-Linac Rotation"
date: 2024-5-1
excerpt: "This rotation was a special rotation tailored to me that lasted until the commissioning of Elekta Unity MR-Linac machine, expected to land in our new cancer center at the end of 2024. I spent significant amount of effort on the principles of MRI and MR-Linac. I finished the book of [Magnetic Resonance Imaging: Physical Principles and Sequence Design 2nd Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Magnetic-Resonance-Imaging-Physical-Principles-ebook/dp/B00K499M2Y), [Utrecht online lecture](https://mrinradiotherapy.com/information-2024/) and joined the Elekta Unity [MR-Linac Consortium](https://mrlconsortium.org/)."

At the same time of my brachytherapy, I started preparation for the commissioning of Elekta Unity MR-Linac machine expected to land in our new cancer center at the end of 2024. I spent significant amount of effort on the principles of MRI and MR-Linac. I finished the book of [Magnetic Resonance Imaging: Physical Principles and Sequence Design 2nd Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Magnetic-Resonance-Imaging-Physical-Principles-ebook/dp/B00K499M2Y), [Utrecht online lecture](https://mrinradiotherapy.com/information-2024/) and joined the Elekta Unity [MR-Linac Consortium](https://mrlconsortium.org/).
