title: "Visiting New York Proton Center"
date: 2024-12-8
excerpt: "I learned spot scanning proton therapy in New York Proton Center. I folster deep understandings on the uncertainties in proton therapy such as physical modeling uncertainty (CT, SPR, SPR conversion, Tissue model), static uncertainty (setup error, non-reproducibility, metal position), dynamic uncertainty (breathing motion, physiological motion and interplay effect), as well as longitudinal uncertainty (tumor change, weight change and anatomical variation). I received extensive training on the treatment planning on both ECLIPSE and Raystation, treatment workflow, physics chart and monthly QA."
