title: "Evaluation of tattoo-less breast RT protocol aided by SGRT"
date: 2023-10-1
excerpt: "I evaluated the effectivenes of SGRT-guided patient setup vs kV/MV imaging for 30 patients treated with the tattoo-less breast RT. The comaprison metrics utilized the dosimetrical evaluation over the entire treatmetn course by accounting for the patient shift in each fraction. It was statistically found that there is no difference between SGRT setup and the conventional setup. This project served our clinical guidance to completely remove daily kV verification. "
