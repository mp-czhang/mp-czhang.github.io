During my three-month machine rotation, I delved deep into the foundamental therapeutic and diagnostic physcis, including the [Khan book](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Khan_s_The_Physics_of_Radiation_Therapy/nSNBAwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0) for basic therapeutic physics, [Attix book](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9783527617135) for comphrehensive dosimetry principles, the [Knoll book](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Radiation+Detection+and+Measurement%2C+4th+Edition-p-9780470131480) for detector physics, the [orange book](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Linear_Accelerators_for_Radiation_Therap/J2C1DwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0) for Linac, and also a [fantastic linac book written in chinese](https://www.google.com/books/edition/%E5%8C%BB%E7%94%A8%E5%8A%A0%E9%80%9F%E5%99%A8/Aq_hAAAACAAJ?hl=en) for more physics-intense Linac knowledge. I also reivewed the lecture notes on radiation phyiscs, dosimetry, semiconductor physics, and linac from my Ph.D advisor Dr Guang-Hong Chen and Dr Ke Li.
