title: "Varian Truebeam™ Annual QA"
date: 2024-6-1
excerpt: "I independently finished all the mechanical part of Varian Truebeam™ annual QA and finished the annual mechanical and dosimetry verification. I learned to use IBA Blue Phantom 2 to perform TG-51 and beam profile measurement (PDD, flatness, symmetry, output factor, cone factor). A comprehensive mechanical check was performed beyong monthly QA including gantry and collimator starshots, output consistency check, MU linearity, off-axis ratio consistency, MLC tansmission measurement, DLG measurement, MV and kVCBCT performance calibration and verification etc. An annual shielding survey was performed to verify the integrity of the shielding design."
