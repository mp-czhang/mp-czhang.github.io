title: "Being proficient in ESAPI"
date: 2023-9-1
excerpt: "ESAPI is a special programming tool for clinical development of ARIA, ECLIPSE and Portal dosimetry developed by Varian. I proficiently mastered ESAPI in my basic treatment planning rotation and it greatly benefited my rotation and research work including the commissioning of VMAT-TBI. I developed and authored several useful codes for data mining, knowledge-based planning, plan automation, beam model verification, dose evaluation, plan quality check, portal dosimetry and etc. Please click to see my representative works.

- I wrote portal dosimetry code to analyze QA failure patterns which depend on the machine, energy, technique,treatment site etc. It served as the foundation to the [DLG] project
- I wrote a code to extract PDD and dose profile calculated by TPS and export them to PTW .mcc and ASCII format for comparison to measured data.
- I wrote a data mining code to extract plan information for Varian's knowledge-based planning database.
- I wrote a code to evaluate clinical dose to account for plan uncertainty.
