title: "Proton Dosimetry Annual QA"
date: 2024-11-1
excerpt: "I completed the annual QA for Mevion S250™ Proton System using PTW MP3-P 3D water tank and PTW trufix PPC05. I measured PDD, flatness and symmetry of selected proton beams. I also used IBA Matrixx to verify the flatness, symmetry and penumbra. We used the PTW farmer chamber to perform absolute dosimetry and verified the machine output. "
