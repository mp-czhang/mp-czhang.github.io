title: "Commissioning of Varian TrueBeam™"
date: 2024-09-03
excerpt: "I am closely working with the physicists to commission the very first Varian TrueBeam™ at our new cancer center. During the commissioning, I gained understandings and hands on experience the isolock™, beam steering and dose tuning. I performed the inventory check, leakage test, radiaiton survey, acceptance test, together with the leading physicist. I operated on the PTW BeamScan Water tank for beam quality scanning, beam profile scanning, DLG, and TG-51 output measurement. The measured data were in close agreement to the gold beam data provided by Varian. The TPS doses calculated in water phantom were also verified by water tank spot checks. In the following schedule, I will perform mechanical check, dosimetry check and kV/MV imaging performance check, end-to-end testS and the commissioning of TSET, conventional TBI, and VMAT-TBI."
