title: "Commissioning of Varian TrueBeam™"
date: 2024-09-03
excerpt: "I am closely working with the physicists to commission the very first Varian TrueBeam™ at our new cancer center. During the commissioning, I gained understandings and hands on experience the isolock™, beam steering and dose tuning. I performed the inventory check, leakage test, radiaiton survey, acceptance test, together with the leading physicist. I operated on the PTW BeamScan Water tank for beam quality scanning, beam profile scanning, DLG, and TG-51 output measurement. The measured data were in close agreement to the gold beam data provided by Varian. In the following schedule, we will perform mechanical check, dosimetry check and kV/MV imaging performance check, spotcheck verification, end-to-end test and the commissioning of TSET, conventional TBI, and VMAT-TBI."
