I independently performed annual QA of the Varian Halcyon™ machine. In the dosimetry part, I set up the IBA blue phantom water tank on the Halcyon machine. Different from the setup for Truebeam™ machine, I ensured clearance of the large water tank in a closed-bore setup, mannually leveled the chamber axes, set up the reference condition using onboard kV imaging and set up the reference chamber in a small field without the light field assistance. I performed the measurement of PDD, beam profile and output factor using the myQA Accept software. The output was checked by TG-51 and tuned to the nominal output. An annual shielding survey was performed to verify the integrity of the shielding design.
