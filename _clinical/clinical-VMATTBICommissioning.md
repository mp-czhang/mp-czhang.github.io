I started to develop, test and validate an advanced treatment procedure for total body irradiation (TBI) using multi-isocenter VMAT. Before the [commissioning of our new cancer center](/_clinical/clinical-TB3Commissioning.md), I grokked and adapted an [open source VMAT-TBI ESAPI algorithm](https://github.com/esimiele/VMAT-TBI) from one of the Rutgers Alumni Dr. Eric Siemele. Treatment plans were done in-silico on several anthropomorphic whole-body phantoms and three real patients simulated in our center. The treatment plans were then evaluated according to multi-institute experience. An end-to-end test was performed on a Rando phantom. The feasibility of using SGRT to setup VMAT-TBI patients was validated. Please click [here](\files\E2ETBI.pdf) for our institutional experience.
