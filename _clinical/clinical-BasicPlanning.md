During my three-month basic planning rotation, I executed over 60 clinical 3D conformal plans ranging from whole brain, T/L-spine, quad-shot, tangential breast, 3-field breast, IM node patching, curative lung plan, electron plans on various sites. The planning was conducted on Varian ECLIPSE I have proficiently utilized dynamic wedges, field-in-field, Dynamic Conforming Arcs, field matching, bolus, and DVH evaluation.
