excerpt: "In my proton rotation, I studied the [Paganetti book](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Proton_Therapy_Physics/IGPRBQAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0), including the Double Scattering System and Pencil Beam Scanning system. I learned the Mervion S250™ System installed in our center. During my rotation, I completed the annual QA, two monthly QA and over 30 patient-specific QA, including the MU determination."

In my proton rotation, I studied the [Paganetti book](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Proton_Therapy_Physics/IGPRBQAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0), including the Double Scattering System and Pencil Beam Scanning system. I learned the Mervion S250™ System installed in our center. During my rotation, I completed the annual QA, two monthly QA and over 30 patient-specific QA, including the MU determination. I also provided physicist in-service to junior residents.
