excerpt: "I am the leading resident to perform the full commissioning of the very first Varian TrueBeam™ at our new cancer center. I independently operated on the PTW BeamScan® Water tank for beam quality scanning, beam profile scanning, DLG/ELM, and TG-51 output measurement. I designe the annual QA template and drafted the commissioning report. *Please click the title to see my major contribution!*"

I am closely working with the physicists to commission the very first Varian TrueBeam™ at our new cancer center. During the commissioning, 
- I gained understandings and hands on experience the isolock™ and beam steering. 
- I performed the inventory check, leakage test, radiaiton survey, acceptance test, together with the leading physicist. 
- I independently operated on the PTW BeamScan® Water tank for beam quality scanning, beam profile scanning, DLG/ELM, and TG-51 output measurement. The TPS doses calculated in water phantom were also verified comprehensively by spot checks in the water tank. 
- I independently performed end-to-end test using SunNuclear Lung and Spine phantom.
- I developed codes to compared the measured PTW data, gold beam data, calculated beam data, TPS plan dose. Here is the [visualization of the result](/files/TB3Report.pdf).
- I designed annual QA template and performed mechanical check, dosimetry check and kV/MV imaging performance check, end-to-end tests.
- I learned to use PTW microdiomnds and W2 Scintillation detector to measure small field dosimetry.
